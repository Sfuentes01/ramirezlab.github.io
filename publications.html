      <h2><a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/294/13/4934.short">The interplay of the metallosensor CueR with two distinct CopZ chaperones defines copper homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h2>
      <h5>Lorena Novoa-Aponte, David Ramírez, José M Argüello</h5>
      <p>Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2019, doi: <link>10.1074/jbc.RA118.006316</link></p>
      <p align="justify">Copper homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria is critical for cuproprotein assembly and virulence. 
        However, <i>in vivo</i> biochemical analyses of these processes are challenging, which has prevented defining and 
        quantifying the homeostatic interplay between Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing transcriptional regulators, chaperones, and 
        sequestering molecules. The cytoplasm of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> contains a Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing 
        transcriptional regulator, CueR, and two homologous metal chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2, forming a unique system for 
        studying Cu<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. We found here that both chaperones exchange Cu<sup>+</sup>, albeit at a slow rate, 
        reaching equilibrium after 3 h, a time much longer than <i>P. aeruginosa</i> duplication time. Therefore, they appeared 
        as two separate cellular Cu<sup>+</sup> pools. Although both chaperones transferred Cu<sup>+</sup> to CueR 
        <i>in vitro</i>, experiments <i>in vivo</i> indicated that CopZ1 metallates CueR, eliciting the translation of 
        Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux transporters involved in metal tolerance. Although this observation was consistent with the 
        relative Cu<sup>+</sup> affinities of the three proteins (CopZ1 < CueR < CopZ2), <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> 
        analyses also indicated a stronger interaction between CopZ1 and CueR that was independent of Cu<sup>+</sup>. 
        In contrast, CopZ2 function was defined by its distinctly high abundance during Cu2<sup>+</sup> stress. 
        Under resting conditions, CopZ2 remained largely in its <i>apo</i> form. Metal stress quickly induced CopZ2 expression, 
        and its <i>holo</i> form predominated, reaching levels commensurate with the cytoplasmic Cu<sup>+</sup> levels. 
        In summary, these results show that CopZ1 acts as chaperone delivering Cu<sup>+</sup> to the CueR sensor, whereas CopZ2 
        functions as a fast-response Cu<sup>+</sup>-sequestering storage protein. We propose that equivalent proteins likely 
        play similar roles in most bacterial systems.</p>

      <h2>The molecular basis for an allosteric inhibition of K<sup>+</sup>-flux gating in K<sub>2P</sub> channels</h2>
      <h5>Susanne Rinne, Aytug K Kiper, Kirsty S Vowinkel, David Ramirez, Marcus Schewe, Mauricio Bedoya, Diana Aser, Isabella Gensler, Michael F Netter, Phillip J Stansfeld, Thomas Baukrowitz, Wendy Gonzalez, Niels Decher</h5>
      <p>eLife, 2019, doi: 10.7554/eLife.39476.001</p>
      <p align="justify">Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological
and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other
potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a
conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites 
        outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. 
        Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed 
        K<sub>+</sub>-flux gating mechanism of K<sup>2P</sup> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of 
        leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide 
        structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class 
        of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.

      <h2>An important role for periplasmic storage in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> copper homeostasis revealed by a combined experimental and computational modeling study</h2>
      <h5>Jignesh H Parmar, Julia Quintana, David Ramírez, Reinhard Laubenbacher, José M Argüello, Pedro Mendes</h5>
  <p>Molecular Microbiology, 2018, doi: 10.1111/mmi.14086</p>
  <p align="justify">Biological systems require precise copper homeostasis enabling metallation of cuproproteins while preventing 
    metal toxicity. In bacteria, sensing, transport, and storage molecules act in coordination to fulfill these roles. 
    However, there is not yet a kinetic schema explaining the system integration. Here, we report a model emerging from 
    experimental and computational approaches that describes the dynamics of copper distribution in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. 
    Based on copper uptake experiments, a minimal kinetic model describes well the copper distribution in the wild‐type 
    bacteria but is unable to explain the behavior of the mutant strain lacking CopA1, a key Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux ATPase. The model was 
    expanded through an iterative hypothesis‐driven approach, arriving to a mechanism that considers the induction of 
    compartmental pools and the parallel function of CopA and Cus efflux systems. Model simulations support the presence of a 
    periplasmic copper storage with a crucial role under dyshomeostasis conditions in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Importantly, the model 
    predicts not only the interplay of periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools but also the existence of a threshold in the 
    concentration of external copper beyond which cells lose their ability to control copper levels.

      <h2>Novel alkylimidazolium ionic liquids as an antibacterial alternative to pathogens of the skin and soft tissue infections</h2>
      <h5>Oscar Forero Doria, Ricardo Castro, Margarita Gutierrez, Diego Gonzalez Valenzuela, Leonardo Santos, David Ramirez, Luis Guzman</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23092354</p>
  <p align="justify">Keeping in mind the concept of green chemistry, this research aims to synthesize and characterize new 
    ionic liquids (ILs) derived from <i>N</i>-cinnamyl imidazole with different sizes of alkyl chains (1, 6, 8, and 10 carbon atoms), 
    and evaluate their antibacterial activity against Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) causative bacteria. 
    The antibacterial screening was carried out by agar well diffusion and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Half 
    Maximum Inhibitory Concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the different ILs were determined by microdilution in broth, also Molecular 
    dynamics simulations were performed to study the interaction mechanism between ILs and membranes. The MIC value in 
    Gram-positive bacteria showed that as the hydrocarbon chain increases, the MIC value decreases with a dose-dependent effect. 
    Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria showed high MIC values, which were also evidenced in the antibacterial screening. 
    The molecular dynamics showed an incorporation of the ILs with the longer chain (10 C), corresponding to a passive diffusion 
    towards the membrane surface, for its part, the ILs with the shorter chain due to its lack of hydrophobicity was not 
    incorporated into the bilayer. Finally, the new ILs synthesized could be an alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive 
    bacteria causative of SSTIs.</p>

      <h2>HCN channels: new therapeutic targets for pain treatment</h2>
      <h5>David Ramírez, Rafael Zúñiga, Guierdy Concha, Leandro Zúñiga</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23092094</p>
  <p align="justify">Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are highly regulated proteins which
    respond to different cellular stimuli. The HCN currents (Ih) mediated by HCN1 and HCN2 drive the repetitive firing in 
    nociceptive neurons. The role of HCN channels in pain has been widely investigated as targets for the development of new 
    therapeutic drugs, but the comprehensive design of HCN channel modulators has been restricted due to the lack of 
    crystallographic data. The three-dimensional structure of the human HCN1 channel was recently reported, opening new 
    possibilities for the rational design of highly-selective HCN modulators. In this review, we discuss the structural and 
    functional properties of HCN channels, their pharmacological inhibitors, and the potential strategies for designing new 
    drugs to block the HCN channel function associated with pain perception.</p>

      <h2>Is it reliable to take the molecular docking top scoring position as the best solution without considering available structural data?</h2>
      <h5>David Ramírez, Julio Caballero</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23051038</p>
  <p align="justify">Molecular docking is the most frequently used computational method for studying the interactions between 
    organic molecules and biological macromolecules. In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand 
    inside a receptor binding site. However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely 
    accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. Here, several rigid-target docking 
    methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding 
    orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. For this, two 
    experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own 
    crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing
    docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). Root-mean 
    square deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate how different the obtained docking orientation is from the corresponding 
    co-crystallized pose of the same ligand molecule. We found that docking score function is capable of predicting 
    crystallographic binding orientations, but the best ranked solution according to the docking energy is not always the pose 
    that reproduces the experimental binding orientation. This happened when self-docking was achieved, but it was critical in 
    cross-docking. Taking into account that docking is typically used with predictive purposes, during cross-docking experiments, 
    our results indicate that the best energy score is not a reliable criterion to select the best solution in common docking
    applications. It is strongly recommended to choose the best docking solution according to the scoring function along with
    additional structural criteria described for analogue ligands to assure the selection of a correct docking solution.</p>
