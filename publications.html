       <h2><a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/294/13/4934.short">The interplay of the metallosensor CueR with two distinct CopZ chaperones defines copper homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h2>
       <h5>Lorena Novoa-Aponte, David Ramírez, José M Argüello</h5>
   <p>Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2019, doi: <link>10.1074/jbc.RA118.006316</link></p>
   <p align="justify">Copper homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria is critical for cuproprotein assembly and virulence. 
        However, <i>in vivo</i> biochemical analyses of these processes are challenging, which has prevented defining and 
        quantifying the homeostatic interplay between Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing transcriptional regulators, chaperones, and 
        sequestering molecules. The cytoplasm of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> contains a Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing 
        transcriptional regulator, CueR, and two homologous metal chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2, forming a unique system for 
        studying Cu<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. We found here that both chaperones exchange Cu<sup>+</sup>, albeit at a slow rate, 
        reaching equilibrium after 3 h, a time much longer than <i>P. aeruginosa</i> duplication time. Therefore, they appeared 
        as two separate cellular Cu<sup>+</sup> pools. Although both chaperones transferred Cu<sup>+</sup> to CueR 
        <i>in vitro</i>, experiments <i>in vivo</i> indicated that CopZ1 metallates CueR, eliciting the translation of 
        Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux transporters involved in metal tolerance. Although this observation was consistent with the 
        relative Cu<sup>+</sup> affinities of the three proteins (CopZ1 < CueR < CopZ2), <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> 
        analyses also indicated a stronger interaction between CopZ1 and CueR that was independent of Cu<sup>+</sup>. 
        In contrast, CopZ2 function was defined by its distinctly high abundance during Cu2<sup>+</sup> stress. 
        Under resting conditions, CopZ2 remained largely in its <i>apo</i> form. Metal stress quickly induced CopZ2 expression, 
        and its <i>holo</i> form predominated, reaching levels commensurate with the cytoplasmic Cu<sup>+</sup> levels. 
        In summary, these results show that CopZ1 acts as chaperone delivering Cu<sup>+</sup> to the CueR sensor, whereas CopZ2 
        functions as a fast-response Cu<sup>+</sup>-sequestering storage protein. We propose that equivalent proteins likely 
        play similar roles in most bacterial systems.</p>

   <p align="justify">Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological
and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other
potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a
conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites 
       outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. 
        Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed 
        K<sub>+</sub>-flux gating mechanism of K<sup>2P</sup> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of 
        leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide 
        structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class 
        of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.</p>

      <h5>Jignesh H Parmar, Julia Quintana, David Ramírez, Reinhard Laubenbacher, José M Argüello, Pedro Mendes</h5>
  <p>Molecular Microbiology, 2018, doi: 10.1111/mmi.14086</p>
  <p align="justify">Biological systems require precise copper homeostasis enabling metallation of cuproproteins while preventing 
    metal toxicity. In bacteria, sensing, transport, and storage molecules act in coordination to fulfill these roles. 
    However, there is not yet a kinetic schema explaining the system integration. Here, we report a model emerging from 
    experimental and computational approaches that describes the dynamics of copper distribution in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. 
    Based on copper uptake experiments, a minimal kinetic model describes well the copper distribution in the wild‐type 
    bacteria but is unable to explain the behavior of the mutant strain lacking CopA1, a key Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux ATPase. The model was 
    expanded through an iterative hypothesis‐driven approach, arriving to a mechanism that considers the induction of 
    compartmental pools and the parallel function of CopA and Cus efflux systems. Model simulations support the presence of a 
    periplasmic copper storage with a crucial role under dyshomeostasis conditions in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Importantly, the model 
    predicts not only the interplay of periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools but also the existence of a threshold in the 
    concentration of external copper beyond which cells lose their ability to control copper levels.

  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23092354</p>
  <p align="justify">Keeping in mind the concept of green chemistry, this research aims to synthesize and characterize new 
    ionic liquids (ILs) derived from <i>N</i>-cinnamyl imidazole with different sizes of alkyl chains (1, 6, 8, and 10 carbon atoms), 
    and evaluate their antibacterial activity against Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) causative bacteria. 
    The antibacterial screening was carried out by agar well diffusion and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Half 
    Maximum Inhibitory Concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the different ILs were determined by microdilution in broth, also Molecular 
    dynamics simulations were performed to study the interaction mechanism between ILs and membranes. The MIC value in 
    Gram-positive bacteria showed that as the hydrocarbon chain increases, the MIC value decreases with a dose-dependent effect. 
    Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria showed high MIC values, which were also evidenced in the antibacterial screening. 
    The molecular dynamics showed an incorporation of the ILs with the longer chain (10 C), corresponding to a passive diffusion 
    towards the membrane surface, for its part, the ILs with the shorter chain due to its lack of hydrophobicity was not 
    incorporated into the bilayer. Finally, the new ILs synthesized could be an alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive

  <p align="justify">Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are highly regulated proteins which
    respond to different cellular stimuli. The HCN currents (Ih) mediated by HCN1 and HCN2 drive the repetitive firing in 
    nociceptive neurons. The role of HCN channels in pain has been widely investigated as targets for the development of new 
    therapeutic drugs, but the comprehensive design of HCN channel modulators has been restricted due to the lack of 
    crystallographic data. The three-dimensional structure of the human HCN1 channel was recently reported, opening new 
    possibilities for the rational design of highly-selective HCN modulators. In this review, we discuss the structural and

      <h5>David Ramírez, Julio Caballero</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23051038</p>
  <p align="justify">Molecular docking is the most frequently used computational method for studying the interactions between 
    organic molecules and biological macromolecules. In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand 
    inside a receptor binding site. However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely 
    accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. Here, several rigid-target docking 
    methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding 
    orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. For this, two 
    experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own 
    crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing
    docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). Root-mean 
    square deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate how different the obtained docking orientation is from the corresponding 
    co-crystallized pose of the same ligand molecule. We found that docking score function is capable of predicting 
    crystallographic binding orientations, but the best ranked solution according to the docking energy is not always the pose 
    that reproduces the experimental binding orientation. This happened when self-docking was achieved, but it was critical in 
    cross-docking. Taking into account that docking is typically used with predictive purposes, during cross-docking experiments, 
    our results indicate that the best energy score is not a reliable criterion to select the best solution in common docking
    applications. It is strongly recommended to choose the best docking solution according to the scoring function along with
    additional structural criteria described for analogue ligands to assure the selection of a correct docking solution.</p>

  <p align="justify">Most snake venom toxins are proteins, and participate to envenomation through a diverse array of 
    bioactivities, such as bleeding, inflammation, and pain, cytotoxic, cardiotoxic or neurotoxic effects. The venom of a single
    snake species contains hundreds of toxins, and the venoms of the 725 species of venomous snakes represent a large pool of 
    potentially bioactive proteins. Despite considerable discovery efforts, most of the snake venom toxins are still 
    uncharacterized. Modern bioinformatics tools have been recently developed to mine snake venoms, helping focus experimental 
    research on the most potentially interesting toxins. Some computational techniques predict toxin molecular targets, and the 
    binding mode to these targets. This review gives an overview of current knowledge on the ~2200 sequences, and more than 400 
    three-dimensional structures of snake toxins deposited in public repositories, as well as of molecular modeling studies of the 
    interaction between these toxins and their molecular targets. We also describe how modern bioinformatics have been used to 
    study the snake venom protein phospholipase A2, the small basic myotoxin Crotamine, and the three-finger peptide Mambalgin.</p>

      <h5>David Ramírez, Wendy Gonzalez, Rafael Fissore, Ingrid Carvacho</h5>
  <p>Marine drugs, 2018, doi: 10.3390/md15100313</p>
  <p align="justify">Voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels are widely expressed and are essential for the completion of multiple physiological processes. Close regulation 
    of their activity by specific inhibitors and agonists become fundamental to understand their role in cellular homeostasis as well
    as in human tissues and organs. Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are divided into two groups depending on the membrane potential required to activate
    them: High-voltage activated (HVA, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.4; Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1–2.3) and Low-voltage activated (LVA, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1–3.3). HVA channels are highly 
    expressed in brain (neurons), heart, and adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells), among others, and are also classified into subtypes 
    which can be distinguished using pharmacological approaches. Cone snails are marine gastropods that capture their prey by 
    injecting venom, “conopeptides”, which cause paralysis in a few seconds. A subset of conopeptides called conotoxins are
    relatively small polypeptides, rich in disulfide bonds, that target ion channels, transporters and receptors localized at the 
    neuromuscular system of the animal target. In this review, we describe the structure and properties of conotoxins that 
    selectively block HVA calcium channels. We compare their potency on several HVA channel subtypes, emphasizing neuronal calcium 
    channels. Lastly, we analyze recent advances in the therapeutic use of conotoxins for medical treatments.</p>

  <p>Molecular pharmaceutics, 2017, doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00005</p>
  <p align="justify">A1899 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the two-pore domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channel TASK-1. It was
    previously reported that A1899 acts as an open-channel blocker and binds to residues of the P1 and P2 regions, the M2 and M4 
    segments, and the halothane response element. The recently described crystal structures of K<sub>2P</sub> channels together with the 
    newly identified side fenestrations indicate that residues relevant for TASK-1 inhibition are not purely facing the central 
    cavity as initially proposed. Accordingly, the TASK-1 binding site and the mechanism of inhibition might need a re-evaluation. 
    We have used TASK-1 homology models based on recently crystallized K<sub>2P</sub> channels and molecular dynamics simulation to
    demonstrate that the highly potent TASK-1 blocker A1899 requires binding to residues located in the side fenestrations. 
    Unexpectedly, most of the previously described residues that interfere with TASK-1 blockade by A1899 project their side chains
    toward the fenestration lumina, underlining the relevance of these structures for drug binding in K2P channels. Despite its 
    hydrophobicity, A1899 does not seem to use the fenestrations to gain access to the central cavity from the lipid bilayer. In 
    contrast, binding of A1899 to residues of the side fenestrations might provide a physical “anchor”, reflecting an 
    energetically favorable binding mode that after pore occlusion stabilizes the closed state of the channels.</p>

  <p align="justify">Despite vast diversity in metabolites and the matching substrate specificity of their transporters, little is
    known about how evolution of transporter substrate specificities is linked to emergence of substrates via evolution of 
    biosynthetic pathways. Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of <i>Brassicales</i> is 
    shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters 
    belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides 
    found across more than 2500 species outside of the <i>Brassicales</i>. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the
    phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <i>A. thaliana</i>, suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters 
    accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of

  <p align="justify">Phospholipases A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>s) constitute a class of extensively studied toxins, isolated from snake venoms. 
    Basic PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms mediate various toxicological effects, while the acidic isoforms generally have higher enzymatic

    completely understood and more studies are needed to characterize the biological functions and diversification of acidic
    toxins in order to justify their abundant presence in these secretions. Recently, Lomonte and collaborators demonstrated, 
    in a proteomic and toxicological study, high concentrations of PLA<sub>2</sub>s in the venom of <i>Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma</i>. 
    We have, herein, purified and characterized an acidic PLA<sub>2</sub> from this snake venom, denominated AplTx-I, in order to better 
    understand its biochemical and structural characteristics, as well as its biological effects. AplTx-I was purified using two 
    chromatographic steps, in association with enzymatic and biological assays. The acidic toxin was found to be one of the most 
    abundant proteins in the venom of <i>A. p. leucostoma</i>; the protein was monomeric with a molecular mass of 13,885.8 Da, as 
    identified by mass spectrometry ESI-TOF and electrophoresis. The toxin has similar primary and tridimensional structures to 
    those of other acidic PLA<sub>2</sub>s, a theoretical and experimental isoelectric point of ≈5.12, and a calcium-dependent enzyme 
    activity of 25.8985 nM/min/mg, with maximum values at 37 °C and pH 8.0. Despite its high enzymatic activity on synthetic 
    substrate, AplTx-I did not induce high or significant myotoxic, coagulant, anticoagulant, edema, neuromuscular toxicity in 
    mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations or antibacterial activities. Interestingly, AplTx-I triggered a high and selective

    phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, denominated CoaTx-II from <i>Crotalus oreganus abyssus</i>, was purified and structurally and pharmacologically
    characterized. CoaTx-II was isolated with a high degree of purity by a combination of two chromatographic steps; molecular 
    exclusion and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This toxin is dimeric with a mass of 13868.2 Da 
    (monomeric form), as determined by mass spectrometry. CoaTx-II is rich in Arg and Lys residues and displays high identity with
    other Lys49 PLA2 homologues, which have high isoelectric points. The structural model of dimeric CoaTx-II shows that the toxin
    is non-covalently stabilized. Despite its enzymatic inactivity, <i>in vivo</i> CoaTx-II caused local muscular damage, characterized 
    by increased plasma creatine kinase and confirmed by histological alterations, in addition to an inflammatory activity, as 
    demonstrated by mice paw edema induction and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 elevation. CoaTx-II also presents antibacterial 
    activity against gram negative (<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> 31NM, <i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 25922) and positive (<i>Staphyloccocus aureus</i> 
    BEC9393 and Rib1) bacteria. Therefore, data show that this newly purified toxin plays a central role in mediating the 
    degenerative events associated with envenomation, in addition to demonstrating antibacterial properties, with potential for
    use in the development of strategies for antivenom therapy and combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>

  <p align="justify">Molecular docking is a computational chemistry method which has become essential for the rational drug design 
    process. In this context, it has had great impact as a successful tool for the study of ligand–receptor interaction modes, and 
    for the exploration of large chemical datasets through virtual screening experiments. Despite their unquestionable merits, 
    docking methods are not reliable for predicting binding energies due to the simple scoring functions they use. However, 
    comparisons between two or three complexes using the predicted binding energies as a criterion are commonly found in the 
    literature. In the present work we tested how wise is it to trust the docking energies when two complexes between a target 
    protein and enantiomer pairs are compared. For this purpose, a ligand library composed by 141 enantiomeric pairs was used, 
    including compounds with biological activities reported against seven protein targets. Docking results using the software 
    Glide (considering extra precision (XP), standard precision (SP), and high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) modes) and 
    AutoDock Vina were compared with the reported biological activities using a classification scheme. Our test failed for all 
    modes and targets, demonstrating that an accurate prediction when binding energies of enantiomers are compared using docking 
    may be due to chance. We also compared pairs of compounds with different molecular weights and found the same results.</p>

  <p>Scientific reports, 2016, doi: 10.1038/srep19492</p>
  <p align="justify">Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels have a large extracellular cap structure formed by two M1-P1 linkers,
    containing a cysteine for dimerization. However, this cysteine is not present in the TASK-1/3/5 subfamily. The functional role
    of the cap is poorly understood and it remained unclear whether K2P channels assemble in the domain-swapped orientation or not.
    Functional alanine-mutagenesis screens of TASK-1 and TRAAK were used to build an <i>in silico model</i> of the TASK-1 cap. According 
    to our data the cap structure of disulfide-bridge free TASK channels is similar to that of other K2P channels and is most 
    likely assembled in the domain-swapped orientation. As the conserved cysteine is not essential for functional expression of
    all K<sub>2P</sub> channels tested, we propose that hydrophobic residues at the inner leaflets of the cap domains can interact with each
    other and that this way of stabilizing the cap is most likely conserved among K<sub>2P</sub> channels.</p>

  <p align="justify">Two-pore domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are membrane proteins widely identified in mammals, plants, and other
    organisms. A functional channel is a dimer with each subunit comprising two pore-forming loops and four transmembrane domains.
    The genome of the model plant <sub>Arabidopsis thaliana</sub> harbors five genes coding for K<sub>2P</sub> channels. Homologs of <i>Arabidopsis</i> K<sub>2P</sub> 
    channels have been found in all higher plants sequenced so far. As with the K<sub>2P</sub> channels in mammals, plant K<sub>2P</sub> channels are 
    targets of external and internal stimuli, which fine-tune the electrical properties of the membrane for specialized transport
    and/or signaling tasks. Plant K2P channels are modulated by signaling molecules such as intracellular H+ and calcium and 
    physical factors like temperature and pressure. In this review, we ask the following: What are the similarities and differences
    between K2P channels in plants and animals in terms of their physiology? What is the nature of the last common ancestor (LCA) 
    of these two groups of proteins? To answer these questions, we present physiological, structural, and phylogenetic evidence
    that discards the hypothesis proposing that the duplication and fusion that gave rise to the K<sub>2P</sub> channels occurred in a 
    prokaryote LCA. Conversely, we argue that the K<sub>2P</sub> LCA was most likely a eukaryote organism. Consideration of plant and animal 
    K2P channels in the same study is novel and likely to stimulate further exchange of ideas between students of these fields.</p>

  <p align="justify">Atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in 
    the industrialized world. There is a high medical need for novel drugs against both diseases, and here, Kv1.5 channels have
    emerged as promising drug targets. In humans, TASK-1 has an atrium-specific expression and TASK-1 is also abundantly expressed
    in the hypoglossal motor nucleus. We asked whether known Kv1.5 channel blockers, effective against atrial fibrillation and/or 
    obstructive sleep apnea, modulate TASK-1 channels. Therefore, we tested Kv1.5 blockers with different chemical structures for 
    their TASK-1 affinity, utilizing two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. Despite the low structural 
    conservation of Kv1.5 and TASK-1 channels, we found all Kv1.5 blockers analyzed to be even more effective on TASK-1 than on 
    Kv1.5. For instance, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of AVE0118 and AVE1231 (A293) were 10- and 
    43-fold lower on TASK-1. Also for MSD-D, ICAGEN-4, S20951 (A1899), and S9947, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.4- to 70-fold lower than
    for Kv1.5. To describe this phenomenon on a molecular level, we used in silico models and identified unexpected structural 
    similarities between the two drug binding sites. Kv1.5 blockers, like AVE0118 and AVE1231, which are promising drugs against 
    atrial fibrillation or obstructive sleep apnea, are in fact potent TASK-1 blockers. Accordingly, block of TASK-1 channels by 
    these compounds might contribute to the clinical effectiveness of these drugs. The higher affinity of these blockers for
    TASK-1 channels suggests that TASK-1 might be an unrecognized molecular target of Kv1.5 blockers effective in atrial
    fibrillation or obstructive sleep apnea.</p>

  <p align="justify">A1899 is a potent and highly selective blocker of the Two-pore domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channel TASK-1, it acts
    as an antagonist blocking the K<sup>+</sup> flux and binds to TASK-1 in the inner cavity and shows an activity in nanomolar order. This
    drug travels through the central cavity and finally binds in the bottom of the selectivity filter with some threonines and 
    waters molecules forming a H-bond network and several hydrophobic interactions. Using alanine mutagenesis screens the binding 
    site was identify involving residues in the P1 and P2 pore loops, the M2 and M4 transmembrane segments, and the halothane
    response element; mutations were introduced in the human TASK-1 (KCNK3, NM_002246) expressed in Oocytes from anesthetized 
    <i>Xenopus laevis</i> frogs. Based in molecular modeling and structural analysis as such as molecular docking and binding free energy 
    calculations a pose was suggested using a TASK-1 homology models. Recently, various K<sub>2P</sub> crystal structures have been obtained.
    We want redefined – from a structural point of view – the binding mode of A1899 in TASK-1 homology models using as a template 
    the K<sub>2P</sub> crystal structures. By computational structural analysis we describe the molecular basis of the A1899 binding mode, 
    how A1899 travel to its binding site and suggest an interacting pose (Figure 1.) after 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulation
    (MDs) we found an intra H-Bond (80% of the total MDs), a H-Bond whit Thr93 (42% of the total MDs), a pi-pi stacking interaction 
    between a ring and Phe125 (88% of the total MDs) and several water bridges. 
Our experimental and computational results allow the molecular understanding of the structural binding mechanism of the selective 
    blocker A1899 to TASK-1 channels. We identified the structural common and divergent features of TASK-1 channel through our

  <p align="justify">Sea anemone neurotoxins are peptides that interact with Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, resulting in specific 
    alterations on their functions. Some of these neurotoxins (1ROO, 1BGK, 2K9E, 1BEI) are important for the treatment of about 80

    among these neurotoxins by computational methods, and establish whether there is a pattern useful for the future generation of
    a treatment for autoimmune diseases. Our results showed eight new key common residues between the studied neurotoxins 
    interacting with a histidine ring and the selectivity filter of the receptor, thus showing a possible pattern of interaction.
