      <h2><a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/294/13/4934.short">The interplay of the metallosensor CueR with two distinct CopZ chaperones defines copper homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h2>
      <h5>Lorena Novoa-Aponte, David Ramírez, José M Argüello</h5>
      <p>Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2019, doi: <link>10.1074/jbc.RA118.006316</link></p>
      <p align="justify">Copper homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria is critical for cuproprotein assembly and virulence. 
        However, <i>in vivo</i> biochemical analyses of these processes are challenging, which has prevented defining and 
        quantifying the homeostatic interplay between Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing transcriptional regulators, chaperones, and 
        sequestering molecules. The cytoplasm of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> contains a Cu<sup>+</sup>-sensing 
        transcriptional regulator, CueR, and two homologous metal chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2, forming a unique system for 
        studying Cu<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. We found here that both chaperones exchange Cu<sup>+</sup>, albeit at a slow rate, 
        reaching equilibrium after 3 h, a time much longer than <i>P. aeruginosa</i> duplication time. Therefore, they appeared 
        as two separate cellular Cu<sup>+</sup> pools. Although both chaperones transferred Cu<sup>+</sup> to CueR 
        <i>in vitro</i>, experiments <i>in vivo</i> indicated that CopZ1 metallates CueR, eliciting the translation of 
        Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux transporters involved in metal tolerance. Although this observation was consistent with the 
        relative Cu<sup>+</sup> affinities of the three proteins (CopZ1 < CueR < CopZ2), <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> 
        analyses also indicated a stronger interaction between CopZ1 and CueR that was independent of Cu<sup>+</sup>. 
        In contrast, CopZ2 function was defined by its distinctly high abundance during Cu2<sup>+</sup> stress. 
        Under resting conditions, CopZ2 remained largely in its <i>apo</i> form. Metal stress quickly induced CopZ2 expression, 
        and its <i>holo</i> form predominated, reaching levels commensurate with the cytoplasmic Cu<sup>+</sup> levels. 
        In summary, these results show that CopZ1 acts as chaperone delivering Cu<sup>+</sup> to the CueR sensor, whereas CopZ2 
        functions as a fast-response Cu<sup>+</sup>-sequestering storage protein. We propose that equivalent proteins likely 
        play similar roles in most bacterial systems.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/39476/elife-39476-v1.pdf">The molecular basis for an allosteric inhibition of K<sup>+</sup>-flux gating in K<sub>2P</sub> channels</a></h2>
      <h5>Susanne Rinne, Aytug K Kiper, Kirsty S Vowinkel, David Ramirez, Marcus Schewe, Mauricio Bedoya, Diana Aser, Isabella Gensler, Michael F Netter, Phillip J Stansfeld, Thomas Baukrowitz, Wendy Gonzalez, Niels Decher</h5>

      <p align="justify">Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological
and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other
potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a
conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites 
        outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. 
        Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed 
        K<sub>+</sub>-flux gating mechanism of K<sup>2P</sup> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of 
        leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide 
        structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class 
        of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.

      <h5>Jignesh H Parmar, Julia Quintana, David Ramírez, Reinhard Laubenbacher, José M Argüello, Pedro Mendes</h5>
  <p>Molecular Microbiology, 2018, doi: 10.1111/mmi.14086</p>
  <p align="justify">Biological systems require precise copper homeostasis enabling metallation of cuproproteins while preventing 
    metal toxicity. In bacteria, sensing, transport, and storage molecules act in coordination to fulfill these roles. 
    However, there is not yet a kinetic schema explaining the system integration. Here, we report a model emerging from 
    experimental and computational approaches that describes the dynamics of copper distribution in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. 
    Based on copper uptake experiments, a minimal kinetic model describes well the copper distribution in the wild‐type 
    bacteria but is unable to explain the behavior of the mutant strain lacking CopA1, a key Cu<sup>+</sup> efflux ATPase. The model was 
    expanded through an iterative hypothesis‐driven approach, arriving to a mechanism that considers the induction of 
    compartmental pools and the parallel function of CopA and Cus efflux systems. Model simulations support the presence of a 
    periplasmic copper storage with a crucial role under dyshomeostasis conditions in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Importantly, the model 
    predicts not only the interplay of periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools but also the existence of a threshold in the 
    concentration of external copper beyond which cells lose their ability to control copper levels.

      <h5>Oscar Forero Doria, Ricardo Castro, Margarita Gutierrez, Diego Gonzalez Valenzuela, Leonardo Santos, David Ramirez, Luis Guzman</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23092354</p>
  <p align="justify">Keeping in mind the concept of green chemistry, this research aims to synthesize and characterize new 
    ionic liquids (ILs) derived from <i>N</i>-cinnamyl imidazole with different sizes of alkyl chains (1, 6, 8, and 10 carbon atoms), 
    and evaluate their antibacterial activity against Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) causative bacteria. 
    The antibacterial screening was carried out by agar well diffusion and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Half 
    Maximum Inhibitory Concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the different ILs were determined by microdilution in broth, also Molecular 
    dynamics simulations were performed to study the interaction mechanism between ILs and membranes. The MIC value in 
    Gram-positive bacteria showed that as the hydrocarbon chain increases, the MIC value decreases with a dose-dependent effect. 
    Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria showed high MIC values, which were also evidenced in the antibacterial screening. 
    The molecular dynamics showed an incorporation of the ILs with the longer chain (10 C), corresponding to a passive diffusion 
    towards the membrane surface, for its part, the ILs with the shorter chain due to its lack of hydrophobicity was not 
    incorporated into the bilayer. Finally, the new ILs synthesized could be an alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive 
    bacteria causative of SSTIs.</p>

  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23092094</p>
  <p align="justify">Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are highly regulated proteins which
    respond to different cellular stimuli. The HCN currents (Ih) mediated by HCN1 and HCN2 drive the repetitive firing in 
    nociceptive neurons. The role of HCN channels in pain has been widely investigated as targets for the development of new 
    therapeutic drugs, but the comprehensive design of HCN channel modulators has been restricted due to the lack of 
    crystallographic data. The three-dimensional structure of the human HCN1 channel was recently reported, opening new 
    possibilities for the rational design of highly-selective HCN modulators. In this review, we discuss the structural and 
    functional properties of HCN channels, their pharmacological inhibitors, and the potential strategies for designing new 
    drugs to block the HCN channel function associated with pain perception.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/5/1038">Is it reliable to take the molecular docking top scoring position as the best solution without considering available structural data?</a></h2>
      <h5>David Ramírez, Julio Caballero</h5>
  <p>Molecules, 2018, doi: 10.3390/molecules23051038</p>
  <p align="justify">Molecular docking is the most frequently used computational method for studying the interactions between 
    organic molecules and biological macromolecules. In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand 
    inside a receptor binding site. However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely 
    accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. Here, several rigid-target docking 
    methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding 
    orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. For this, two 
    experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own 
    crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing
    docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). Root-mean 
    square deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate how different the obtained docking orientation is from the corresponding 
    co-crystallized pose of the same ligand molecule. We found that docking score function is capable of predicting 
    crystallographic binding orientations, but the best ranked solution according to the docking energy is not always the pose 
    that reproduces the experimental binding orientation. This happened when self-docking was achieved, but it was critical in 
    cross-docking. Taking into account that docking is typically used with predictive purposes, during cross-docking experiments, 
    our results indicate that the best energy score is not a reliable criterion to select the best solution in common docking
    applications. It is strongly recommended to choose the best docking solution according to the scoring function along with
    additional structural criteria described for analogue ligands to assure the selection of a correct docking solution.</p>

  <p>Toxins, 2018, doi: 10.3390/toxins10010008</p>
  <p align="justify">Most snake venom toxins are proteins, and participate to envenomation through a diverse array of 
    bioactivities, such as bleeding, inflammation, and pain, cytotoxic, cardiotoxic or neurotoxic effects. The venom of a single
    snake species contains hundreds of toxins, and the venoms of the 725 species of venomous snakes represent a large pool of 
    potentially bioactive proteins. Despite considerable discovery efforts, most of the snake venom toxins are still 
    uncharacterized. Modern bioinformatics tools have been recently developed to mine snake venoms, helping focus experimental 
    research on the most potentially interesting toxins. Some computational techniques predict toxin molecular targets, and the 
    binding mode to these targets. This review gives an overview of current knowledge on the ~2200 sequences, and more than 400 
    three-dimensional structures of snake toxins deposited in public repositories, as well as of molecular modeling studies of the 
    interaction between these toxins and their molecular targets. We also describe how modern bioinformatics have been used to 
    study the snake venom protein phospholipase A2, the small basic myotoxin Crotamine, and the three-finger peptide Mambalgin.</p>

      <h5>David Ramírez, Wendy Gonzalez, Rafael Fissore, Ingrid Carvacho</h5>
  <p>Marine drugs, 2018, doi: 10.3390/md15100313</p>
  <p align="justify">Voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels are widely expressed and are essential for the completion of multiple physiological processes. Close regulation 
    of their activity by specific inhibitors and agonists become fundamental to understand their role in cellular homeostasis as well
    as in human tissues and organs. Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are divided into two groups depending on the membrane potential required to activate
    them: High-voltage activated (HVA, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.4; Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1–2.3) and Low-voltage activated (LVA, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1–3.3). HVA channels are highly 
    expressed in brain (neurons), heart, and adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells), among others, and are also classified into subtypes 
    which can be distinguished using pharmacological approaches. Cone snails are marine gastropods that capture their prey by 
    injecting venom, “conopeptides”, which cause paralysis in a few seconds. A subset of conopeptides called conotoxins are
    relatively small polypeptides, rich in disulfide bonds, that target ion channels, transporters and receptors localized at the 
    neuromuscular system of the animal target. In this review, we describe the structure and properties of conotoxins that 
    selectively block HVA calcium channels. We compare their potency on several HVA channel subtypes, emphasizing neuronal calcium 
    channels. Lastly, we analyze recent advances in the therapeutic use of conotoxins for medical treatments.</p>

      <h5>David Ramírez, Bárbara Arévalo, Gonzalo Martínez, Susanne Rinné, Francisco V Sepúlveda, Niels Decher, Wendy González</h5>
  <p>Molecular pharmaceutics, 2017, doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00005</p>
  <p align="justify">A1899 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the two-pore domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channel TASK-1. It was
    previously reported that A1899 acts as an open-channel blocker and binds to residues of the P1 and P2 regions, the M2 and M4 
    segments, and the halothane response element. The recently described crystal structures of K<sub>2P</sub> channels together with the 
    newly identified side fenestrations indicate that residues relevant for TASK-1 inhibition are not purely facing the central 
    cavity as initially proposed. Accordingly, the TASK-1 binding site and the mechanism of inhibition might need a re-evaluation. 
    We have used TASK-1 homology models based on recently crystallized K<sub>2P</sub> channels and molecular dynamics simulation to
    demonstrate that the highly potent TASK-1 blocker A1899 requires binding to residues located in the side fenestrations. 
    Unexpectedly, most of the previously described residues that interfere with TASK-1 blockade by A1899 project their side chains
    toward the fenestration lumina, underlining the relevance of these structures for drug binding in K2P channels. Despite its 
    hydrophobicity, A1899 does not seem to use the fenestrations to gain access to the central cavity from the lipid bilayer. In 
    contrast, binding of A1899 to residues of the side fenestrations might provide a physical “anchor”, reflecting an 
    energetically favorable binding mode that after pore occlusion stabilizes the closed state of the channels.</p>

  <p>Elife, 2017, doi: 10.7554/eLife.19466</p>
  <p align="justify">Despite vast diversity in metabolites and the matching substrate specificity of their transporters, little is
    known about how evolution of transporter substrate specificities is linked to emergence of substrates via evolution of 
    biosynthetic pathways. Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of <i>Brassicales</i> is 
    shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters 
    belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides 
    found across more than 2500 species outside of the <i>Brassicales</i>. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the
    phylogenetic lineage from cassava to <i>A. thaliana</i>, suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters 
    accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of 
    the biosynthetic pathways, exemplify how transporter substrate specificities originate and evolve as new biosynthesis pathways
    emerge.</p>
